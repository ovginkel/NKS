This file shortly describes some of the details to get NKS up and running and how you can contribute.

### What is this repository for? ###

NKS provides for a low privacy footprint messaging app that links to the Slack API for an individual member of a team.
It was inspired by SlackContacts and the need for it at a Youth Camp.

### How do I get set up? ###

Android studio with gradle is required to build.
There are several dependencies which would be automatically downloaded by gradle.
An existing slack team login would be required to test run NKS.

### Contribution guidelines ###

Please download the app and provide feedback on the wiki in terms of use and feature requests.
Small excerpts from debug logs for specific devices where problems occur would be highly appreciated.
Translations into other languages would be extremely valuable.

### Who do I talk to? ###

Kindly speak to the repo owner on any clarification until liaison tasks had been delegated to other willing contributers.
